# Capstone Project: Autonomous Humanoid Robot System

## Project Overview

The capstone project represents the culmination of the 14-week Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics curriculum, requiring students to design, implement, and demonstrate a complete autonomous humanoid robot system. This project integrates all major concepts covered throughout the course, including ROS 2 architecture, simulation environments, NVIDIA Isaac Platform, and Vision-Language-Action systems.

## Project Goals

### Primary Objective
Design and implement an autonomous humanoid robot that can:
- Navigate through complex environments using SLAM and path planning
- Interpret natural language commands and execute appropriate actions
- Perform manipulation tasks using vision-based perception
- Demonstrate safe and reliable operation in simulated and/or physical environments

### Learning Integration
Students will demonstrate mastery of:
- **ROS 2 Architecture**: Advanced node design, message passing, and system integration
- **Simulation**: Gazebo environment design and physics-based simulation
- **NVIDIA Isaac**: GPU-accelerated perception and navigation systems
- **VLA Systems**: Vision-language-action integration for embodied intelligence
- **System Engineering**: Architecture design, testing, and deployment best practices

## Technical Requirements

### Core Components
1. **Perception System**
   - Real-time object detection and recognition
   - 3D scene understanding and mapping
   - Multi-modal sensor fusion

2. **Cognition System**
   - Natural language understanding and command parsing
   - Task planning and execution
   - Decision making under uncertainty

3. **Action System**
   - Navigation and path planning
   - Manipulation and grasping
   - Human-robot interaction

4. **Integration Framework**
   - ROS 2-based communication architecture
   - NVIDIA Isaac GPU acceleration
   - Real-time performance optimization

### Performance Metrics
- **Navigation**: Success rate >85% in complex environments
- **Language Understanding**: >90% command interpretation accuracy
- **Manipulation**: >75% success rate for basic grasping tasks
- **System Response**: <2 second response time for simple commands
- **Reliability**: <5% system failures during 30-minute operation
